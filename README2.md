### 1. Python Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) API
A simple crud api built with (flask) python and mysql database. Initially, A docker image for mysql was used and port 3307 was opened.
But later an online free mysql database was provisioned using [Free Online MySQL](https://remotemysql.com/).


### 2. CI/CD pipeline with CircleCI and Heroku

CI was configure with [CirceCI](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/profbiyi). and CD with [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/pipelines/2e419849-9de8-42c0-b07e-13eb980d4f27/). I went for this option as it gives me an opportunity to test out different tools. 

The home page of this api [Homepage](https://dstistudents.herokuapp.com/)



### 3. Docker and Docker Compose
A `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` to build the applciation and then to start it.

A docker image was created, tagged and successfully hosted on [profbiyi/mydstistudents_crud_api](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/profbiyi/mydstistudents_crud_api). To use the image, ensure that ports 5000, and 3306 are openned and connect to the app using localhost:5000


### 4. Kubernetes

1. Install Kubernetes cluster using Minikube
2. Two files were created for deployment and services
  - deployments with three pods - `flask_api-deployment.yml`
  - services - `flask_k8_service.yml`
3. 

### 5.  Istio
